# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup for Firebase

## ‚úÖ What's Been Done

1. Created `.github/workflows/firebase-deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
2. Generated Firebase CI token (stored locally - see below for setup)

## üîß What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Add Secrets to GitHub Repository

Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/equinox1897-sudo/Equinox

1. Click **Settings** tab
2. Click **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions** (in left sidebar)
3. Click **New repository secret**

#### Add these TWO secrets:

**Secret 1: FIREBASE_TOKEN**
- Name: `FIREBASE_TOKEN`
- Value: Run `firebase login:ci` in your terminal to generate a new token, then copy it here

**Secret 2: FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT**
- Name: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
- Value: Copy the entire contents of your local `serviceAccountKey.json` file (do NOT commit this file to Git)

### Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

After adding the secrets, commit and push your code:

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI/CD for Firebase deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Watch It Deploy!

1. Go to https://github.com/equinox1897-sudo/Equinox/actions
2. You'll see the "Deploy to Firebase" workflow running
3. Click on it to watch the progress live
4. When complete, your site will be deployed to https://equinox-b1604.web.app

## üéØ How It Works

The workflow triggers on:
- **Every push to `main` branch** - Automatic deployment
- **Manual trigger** - You can click "Run workflow" in GitHub Actions tab

It will:
1. ‚úÖ Install dependencies (root and functions)
2. ‚úÖ Deploy static files to Firebase Hosting
3. ‚úÖ Deploy Firestore rules and indexes
4. ‚úÖ Deploy Functions (if on Blaze plan, otherwise skips gracefully)

## üìã Manual Deployment Commands

You can still deploy manually anytime:

```powershell
# Deploy everything
firebase deploy

# Deploy only hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting

# Deploy only Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore

# Deploy only Functions (requires Blaze plan)
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## üîç Monitoring

- **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/equinox1897-sudo/Equinox/actions
- **Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/equinox-b1604
- **Live Site**: https://equinox-b1604.web.app

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. The workflow will **NOT fail** if Functions deployment fails (Spark plan limitation)
2. Secrets are encrypted in GitHub - only the workflow can access them
3. Every push to `main` triggers deployment - be careful with direct commits
4. You can create a `dev` branch for testing and only merge to `main` when ready to deploy

## üöÄ Best Practices

1. **Create a dev branch for development:**
   ```powershell
   git checkout -b dev
   # Make changes, test locally
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   git push origin dev
   ```

2. **Merge to main when ready to deploy:**
   ```powershell
   git checkout main
   git merge dev
   git push origin main  # This triggers deployment!
   ```

3. **Use Pull Requests** for code review before deployment

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If deployment fails:**
1. Check the Actions tab for error logs
2. Verify secrets are correctly set in repository settings
3. Ensure Firebase project has billing enabled (for Functions)

**If Functions don't deploy:**
- This is expected on Spark plan
- Upgrade to Blaze plan: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/equinox-b1604/usage/details

**If Firestore rules fail:**
- Check firestore.rules syntax in Firebase Console
- Ensure indexes are properly defined in firestore.indexes.json
